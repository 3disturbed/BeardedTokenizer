Bearded Tokenization: A Comprehensive Approach to Context-Aware Multipass Tokenization for Python Code
Abstract

This paper introduces "Bearded Tokenization," a novel multipass tokenization approach designed to handle Python code with a specific focus on coding syntax and context. Unlike traditional tokenizers, Bearded Tokenization prioritizes the recognition of longest and most complex tokens first, ensuring accurate representation of Python syntax, including handling of tabs and spaces, which are crucial for Python's indentation-based structure. This methodology is particularly beneficial for large language models (LLMs) generating Python code from English pseudocode.
Introduction

Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP) and programming language parsing. Traditional tokenizers often struggle with context-specific patterns and complex syntax, especially in languages like Python, where indentation and context significantly affect meaning. Bearded Tokenization addresses these challenges by employing a multipass strategy that prioritizes longest tokens and context-aware patterns first, followed by more general patterns.
Motivation

The primary motivation behind Bearded Tokenization is to enhance the performance and accuracy of LLMs in understanding and generating Python code. By accurately tokenizing code, including specific patterns like import numpy as np and print(, and recognizing the significance of indentation, this approach aims to improve the syntactic and semantic understanding of Python code.
Methodology
Token Specification

Bearded Tokenization employs a comprehensive token specification that includes specific patterns, general syntax elements, and whitespace handling. The tokens are ordered by priority to ensure longest match first.
Token Types

    Specific Patterns:
        IMPORT_NUMPY: Matches import numpy as np
        PRINT_FUNC: Matches print(

    General Patterns:
        COMMENT: Matches single-line comments (#)
        MULTILINE_STRING: Matches multi-line strings (""" ... """ or ''' ... ''')
        STRING: Matches single-line strings (" ... " or ' ... ')
        KEYWORD: Matches Python keywords (e.g., if, else, for, etc.)
        LIBRARY: Matches common library names (e.g., np, pd, tf)
        OPERATOR: Matches operators and punctuation (e.g., ==, !=, =, +, -, etc.)
        NUMBER: Matches numeric literals
        IDENTIFIER: Matches variable and function names

    Whitespace Handling:
        NEWLINE: Matches newline characters
        TAB: Matches tab characters
        SPACE: Matches sequences of spaces

    Mismatched Characters:
        MISMATCH: Matches any other character

Implementation

The tokenization process involves multiple passes over the input code, each pass focusing on different token types. This ensures that complex patterns are matched first, followed by simpler patterns.
Tokenization Process

    Initialization:
        Define the token specification with patterns and priorities.
        Initialize an empty list to store tokens.

    Multipass Tokenization:
        For each token type, compile the regex pattern.
        Match the pattern in the remaining code and append matched tokens to the token list.
        Replace matched patterns with spaces in the remaining code to prevent overlapping matches.

    Sorting and Filtering:
        Sort tokens by their position in the original code.
        Filter out skip tokens (spaces and tabs) if not needed explicitly.

    Output:
        Return the sorted and filtered list of tokens.

Example Implementation

python

import re

class BeardedTokenizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.token_specification = [
            ('IMPORT_NUMPY', r'\bimport numpy as np\b'),
            ('PRINT_FUNC', r'\bprint\s*\('),
            ('COMMENT', r'#.*'),  # Single-line comments
            ('MULTILINE_STRING', r'\"\"\".*?\"\"\"|\'\'\'.*?\'\'\''),  # Multi-line strings
            ('STRING', r'\".*?\"|\'.*?\''),  # Single-line strings
            ('KEYWORD', r'\b(?:if|else|for|while|def|return|import|from|as|class)\b'),
            ('LIBRARY', r'\b(?:np|pd|tf)\b'),  # NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow
            ('OPERATOR', r'==|!=|<=|>=|=|\+|-|\*|/|<|>|!|\(|\)|\[|\]|\{|\}|,|:'),
            ('NUMBER', r'\b\d+(\.\d*)?\b'),
            ('IDENTIFIER', r'\b[A-Za-z_]\w*\b'),
            ('NEWLINE', r'\n'),
            ('TAB', r'\t'),  # Tabs
            ('SPACE', r' +'),  # Spaces
            ('MISMATCH', r'.'),  # Any other character
        ]

    def tokenize(self, code):
        token_list = []
        remaining_code = code

        for kind, pattern in self.token_specification:
            regex = re.compile(pattern)
            for match in regex.finditer(remaining_code):
                token_list.append((kind, match.group(), match.start(), match.end()))

            # Remove matched patterns from the remaining code
            remaining_code = regex.sub(lambda m: ' ' * (m.end() - m.start()), remaining_code)

        # Sort tokens by their position in the original code
        token_list.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])

        return token_list

# Example usage
code = '''
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf

def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
'''
tokenizer = BeardedTokenizer()
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(code)
for token in tokens:
    print(token)
